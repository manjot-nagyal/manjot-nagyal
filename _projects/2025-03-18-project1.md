## Project Overview
A containerized REST API for analyzing microbiome data, built with FastAPI. This API allows users to upload microbiome abundance data in JSON or CSV format and perform various diversity and correlation analyses.

### Features
1. Data Upload and Management: Support for both CSV and JSON microbiome data formats with sample metadata integration
2. Diversity Analysis: Calculates alpha diversity metrics (Shannon, Simpson, Pielou, Chao1) and beta diversity metrics (Bray-Curtis, Jaccard)
3. Correlation Analysis: Analyzes relationships between microbial taxa and sample metadata
4. Statistical Testing: Performs group comparisons using Mann-Whitney U tests to identify significant differences
5. Interactive Visualizations: Provides heatmaps, scatter plots, and other visualizations for analyzing microbial communities
6. RESTful API Documentation: Includes Swagger UI and ReDoc for comprehensive API documentation
Containerized Deployment: Offers Docker-based deployment for easy installation and consistent environments
